          I like to develope software. It is as simple as it is. <br><br>
          I started programming Java with my study in 2005/2006. Since that time I worked with this language, especially when I was a Java Consultant. <br><br>
          I like the concepts of the language. The object orientated design without is not too complex especially because it doen't support multiple inheritance like C++. Therefore it contains a easy to handle type system with its generics and interfaces. <br>
          With Java 8 new interesting and probably necessary changes and improvements were made to keep the language alive and used. <br><br>
          But regardless of the language and technology that is used, the most important reason for me being a developer is to be creative. As a digital engineer one has the chance to solve problems in different ways. It is like cooking: The recipes with their incidences are the same, but each chef can cook them in a different way and use different spices. The outcome are very different dishes. <br>
          And yes...that is why I like cooking as well, even without the possibility of pressing CTRL + Z. Cooked is cooked!

          In 2011 when I was working as a Java Consultant, I passed the OCP Java 6. Even though I was using Java profressionally, it was still pretty hard and I learned surprisingly many new features and facts about the language I was using every day. <br>
          I doubt that every certification nowadays has a reason to exist but you can be sure that the person who passed this one, does know Java. The exam is tough what makes sure one understands the whole topic. <br>
          I'm happy to have done it because it forced me to dive deeper into details, I wouldn't have done just with day by day usage. And yes, I feel the deeper knowledge helps in the daily work too. <br><br>
          Another course I learned something about Java on a more conceptual way was the course "OOP" I took 2013 from the university in Hagen.

          In the beginning of 2016 I made myself familiarwith up-to-date Web technologies. I started with studying several courses at Lynda.com to get a practical introduction from professionals. </br></br>
          After this session on Lynda  I built our travel blog. This was a technical playground where I used several features of HTML and CSS3 as well as JavaScript libraries like jQuery or MustacheJS. Rather than using a platform like Bootstrap I defined the responsiveness and behaviour of the page by myself via JS and CSS. It also uses a database to load the content from which pushes it's complexity again. </br></br>
          Having finished the travel-blog I got in touch with Bootstrap and built this homepage. </br>

        <p class="text-justify">
          As a Java Consultant I was mainly responsible for developing JEE applications. <br>
          Together with the Web technologies (text above) it makes even more fun to build Java applications for the full stack. <br>
          Right now I'm reading a book which plugs all of these parts together. It has the title "Digital Java EE 7 Web Application Development". Focusing on the presentation tier, the author shows the integration of several different Web technologies such as AngularJS into a JEE application. <br><br>
          A few years ago, one could still see the line between these two worlds of development which is slowly going to be dissolved. Java developers code JavaScript too. They know how to use EJB or JPA as well as jQuery or Bootstrap. The author is titeling these developers as Digital Developer, others call them Full Stack. This labeling is just a trend but it will become more and more usual to know several stacks due to the fast Web and the shifting borders.
